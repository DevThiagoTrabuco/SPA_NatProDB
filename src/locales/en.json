    "home": "NatProDB contains 556 compounds in 2D formats ready for docking. The motivation for building NatProDB arose from the fact that the semi-arid region of Brazil is little studied and lacks natural product repositories. NatProDB was conceived by the Molecular Modeling Laboratory and the High-Performance Computing Laboratory of the State University of Feira de Santana. This website allows you to view the structures, their properties, and search the database.",
